# OpenDaemon 0.7.0 installation instructions
--------------------------------------------

Note: OpenDaemon was not compiled except on the development platform 
which has the following charasteristics:

Linux 2.4.8-26mdk
glibc 2.3.1
gcc 3.2.2
GNU bison 1.35
flex 2.5.4 

# Server Compilation:
---------------------

In main/src of the distribution:

$ make

# Client Compilation:
---------------------

In main/src/client of the distribution:

$ gcc echoserver_client.c ../sockets.c -o echoserver_client

# Running and testing:
----------------------

In main/src of the distribution:

$ ./opendaemon

A message like this one should be generated:

OpenDaemon is up and running:
	* Main PID: ????
	* EchoServer is on port 8080 as EchoServerTry
	
Note: The listening port is configured through the opendaemon.conf file--
just in case this needs to be changed.

In main/src/client, run the client:

$ ./echoserver_client

Expected Output:

Hello World!


# What Happened ?
-----------------

OpenDaemon is now a generic server platform, EchoServer is an echo 
interface code plugged into OpenDaemon's code which you have compiled
and ran, EchoServerTry is an instance of of the EchoServer interface code,
The one that answered your "Hello World!" with a "Hello World!".

EchoServer is intended for system sanity testing purposes, the system
is designed to hold inside it interfaces of more interest :-)

Creating a generic server platform was a development decision,
so when XMLD-SQL and Engine-XMLD are plugged back into the whole thing 
they are plugged on stable grounds.

# Feedback:
-----------

This release should be a bit of stable, and I don't think there's
going to be major core changes within next releases (the current code is very 
generic) so if you notice segfaults or erratic behaviour in this simple test 
case, or in any one you make yourself, please report this behaviour:
