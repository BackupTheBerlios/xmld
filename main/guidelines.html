* Definition:
-------------
 The OpenXMLD is a native XML database server.
 
* General goals:
----------------
 * Increase usability of native XML databases.
 * The OpenXMLD will be licenced under the GNU GPL.

* Technical goals:
------------------
 * The OpenXMLD must implement its own query language defined in the QUERY.html
   file, which should aim at being SQL-compliant and XML-capable.
 * The OpenXMLD should be cross-platform (At some point. Initially write it to
   facilitate this in the future).
 * The OpenXMLD must parse documents on-disk.
 * The OpenXMLD must provide support for speedy in-memory parsing of documents.
 * The OpenXMLD must provide a plugin architecture.
 * The OpenXMLD project must maintain (or provide the foundation of) a basic C client 
   library.
 * The OpenXMLD xml processors should be splittable.
 * The OpenXMLD must be easy to use.
 * The OpenXMLD mustn't hide any of XML's data storage capabilities.
 * As performant as possible. (least processing time, least memory consumption po-
   ssible)

* Management:
-------------
 * The OpenXMLD will contain a PARTS.html document which will contain a list of 
 the parts forming it (e.g Query parser)
 * Every part will have a separate README document (README.<part>), everyone 
 working in that part must read this document first.
