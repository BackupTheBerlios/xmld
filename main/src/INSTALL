# The OpenXMLD 0.5.0 INSTALL document
-------------------------------------

Note: The OpenXMLD is not guaranteed to compile except
on the development platform which has the following
charasteristics:

Linux 2.4.8-26mdk
glibc 2.2.4
gcc 3.3
GNU bison 1.28
flex 2.5.4 

# Server Compilation:
---------------------

In main/src of the distribution:

$ make

# Client Compilation:
---------------------

In main/src/client of the distribution:

$ make

Report any compilation problems please (read
the feedback section at the bottom).

# Running and testing:
----------------------

In main/src of the distribution:

$ ./xmld

A message like this one should be generated:

The OpenXMLD is up and running:
	* Main PID: ????
	* Listening port 1: ?
	* Listening port 2: ?
	[...]
	
These ports are listed in the xmld.conf file in
the "Socket manager controls".

In main/src/client, run the client:

$ ./xmldclient

If the client asks for a port write one of those
which are listed when running the server.

The client will ask for a user name and a password,
currently the only added user is: khalid with 
password: pass

You could have run the client that way:

./xmldclient <port> <username>

or:

./xmldclient <port>

typically (with default 0.5.0 xmld.conf):

./xmldclient 6666 khalid

# The Document Root:
--------------------

As of the default 0.5.0 xmld.conf, the document root of
the server is main/src/document_root. It contains
two small example files:

file.xml
file2.xml

along with their format documents:

file.xml.format
file2.xml.format

You can query both, or add your own, or just change the
document root in xmld.conf to anything else. Note that
if you are going to execute SELECT queries against any
file, you don't need a format document, but if you
are going to execute a SELECT with WHERE query
you do need a format document which will be created 
automatically in the future by the CREATE TABLE/FILE 
command.

# Querying The Server
---------------------

Read the QUERY.html document to understand the XMLD-SQL query
language. After authentication, the client would show you a
prompt:

xmld>

Write a query and end it with ";" and see what happens. Note
that only SELECT and SELECT with WHERE queries are supported
(along with their bugs).

# Query Examples:
-----------------

With the default document root:

select !:name from "file.xml"
select !:~name from "file.xml"
select !:name from "file.xml" where !:name="khalid"
select !:"file.xml".name, "file2.xml".name from "file.xml", "file2.xml"

# Feedback:
-----------

This is an alpha quality release. It would segfault and it would behave
incorrectly--there's a big number of known bugs. The 0.6.0 release
will contain a lot of core changes, the reason for which extensive
bug fixing is no use right now, however feel free to send questions
, suggestions or whatever to:
