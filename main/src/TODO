  * Multi-levelled data sets. (done)
  * Node labelling (tagnames in XML). (done)  

* Engine capability level specification bitmask. (done)

* Engine access level macros should be generic and simpler. (done)

* Better passage of file names from the tree walker to the engine.
  * XMLDFile can contain an additional field that carries the full
    actual file path from the document root ?  (done)
  * No longer should XMLDFile_get_full_file be needed. (done)

* Addition of data source modification functions to the engine API. (done)
  * Capability bit. (done)

* cfg_parser must be rewritten using bison and flex for
  cleanliness reasons.
  * Write cfg_parser.lex (done).

  * XMLDCfgSection (with support for subsections -- done).
  * XMLDDirective refinement. -> (XMLDCfgDirective -- done)
  * XMLDCfgValue (done).

    tree as input and fills it. (done)
  * Each part should manipulate cfg data structures directly.
    * Reimplement cfg_get that supports a section name and
      a parent section structure arguments (NULL in case of
      cfg_tree). (done -- returns XMLDCfgValueList)
    * Devise an API in cfg that eases retrival of directives
      it just is really hard to do right now.
       * XMLDCfgSection_get_section: (done)
         * The index of the section.
       * XMLDCfgSection_get_directive: (done)

  index was not correct, and not the last found element! (done)

  to the configuration file with support for interface parameters.
  * interface_list creates a list according to defines at first.
    (done)
  * XMLDInterface_copy (done)
  * XMLDInteface.init should receive parameters. (done)

  has its own protocol.
  * No longer is authman_handle needed in somanager. (done)
  * somanager_user_connection --> XMLDInterface->user_connection.
    (done).
  * somanager_handle should send only the interface pointer
    to XMLDInterface->user_connection. (done)
  * remove XMLDConnection. (done)

* Fix that somanager passes the interface name through conn.user
  then search for its structure a second time. (done)

* remove client, xmldsql, engine_xmld from the source tree. (done)

* Generic Data Storage API -- to remove database server-specific
  fields from different structures.
   * XMLDAssoc -- Thread-safe associative array implementation:
     * Numeric and String index support. (ok)
     * No internal iterators. (ok)
     * Automatic reusage of already allocated memory segments. (done)
     * Automatic length calculation. (ok)
   * xmld_assoc.h (done)

   * XMLDWork (done)
   * XMLDFile (done)
   * XMLDInterface (done)

* Support for re-parsing of the configuration on the fly.
  * mtasker support function for signaling.
    * mtasker_signal_children. (done)
    * main process handles SIGUSR2 as a configuration update signal
      and calls mtasker_signal_children with SIGUSR2. (done)
  * Child processes should run a cfg function on receiving of signal. (done)
  * cfg_update. (done)
  * somanager, interface_list should be restarted to update the
    listening sockets and the interfaces. (done)

* Erase task table in ptasker, the main process should loop
  until it finds a free child to use. (done)
  
* Erase usage of mutils. (done)

* Real implementation of engine association functions.
  * maybe a clean up of the whole system ?

* Real implementation of mfigure.

* Data source creation functions.
  * A new access level bit ?
  * Ability to use the engine on an empty XMLDFile.
  * Capability bit.

* Data source alteration (reshaping) functions.
  * Capability bit.

* Put supplementary APIs in one place:
  * Engine Association API, XMLDEngine structure and mfigure.
  * On Disk Data Manipulation API. (dutils)
  * String Manipulation API. (sutils)
  * Authentication API. (authman)
  * File Opening and Locking API. (fmanager)
  * Localized Messages System. (gettext)
  * Support for dependencies ?
    * authman needs a storage engine!
    * modules.conf file ?
  * configure script and make file for each ?
  
* Implementation of localized messages subsystem.

* Error messages:
  * Provide routines of error reporting in engines
    and interfaces.
  * Error messages subsystem -- gettext().
  * Engines report errors to interfaces and interfaces report them 
    to the system as "Engine error: <engine message>"
  * Interfaces report errors through their own protocols to the 
    client and decide whether to terminate the user connection.
  * Remove error arrays and defines from xmld.c, init.h and xmlddef.h. (done)

* Remove protoimpl and its documentation. (done)

* Implement an EchoServer interface for demonstration.

* Usage of autoconf to decide on the modules to be compiled.

* Separate make files for EchoServer and ptasker.

* Rename to OpenDaemon.

* Remove old documents from the docs page.

Issues:
-------

* authman must encode/decode user authentication tokens.

* rename XMLDFile.element_pos to XMLDFile.node_pos (done).

* Configuration of the user and the group under which
  OpenXMLD is to run.

*--------------- Start of OpenXMLD 0.8.0 part:

Goal: Strength.

* Portable loadable modules support.

* Support for loading of a module on demand.

* cleaner, more portable sockets API.

* Thread-safe core.
  * XMLDAssoc semaphore/mutex usage.

* Implement a multi-threaded multi-tasker (Macro: USE_TTASKER).

* Re-implement fmanager using a flock-independent way once MULTI_THREAD_MTASKER is on.

* Implement a path translation API that modifies the path according to the OS.

* Portable way to pass sockets between processes.
