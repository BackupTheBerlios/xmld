* Make a unified <what ever>Table API for:
 
   * XMLDExprTable
   * XMLDCondTable
   * XMLDFuncTable
   * XMLDAggrTableTable
   * XMLDConnectionTable ? (maybe turning the shm in sosel to it)

* After making the above mentioned unified API and creating
  a header file for each structure of the mentioned above, 
  check for places where the API isn't used, and use it.

* HAVE_XMLD_MEMPOOL_H -> HAVE_XMLD_MEM_POOL_H
