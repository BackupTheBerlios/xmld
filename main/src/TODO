*--------------- Start of OpenXMLD 0.7.0 part:

Goal: Cleanliness.

Foundation:
-----------

* The engine interface must be generic, with support for:
  * Multi-levelled data sets.
  * Node labelling (tagnames in XML).

* cfg_parser must be rewritten using bison and flex for
  cleanliness reasons.

* xmld.conf must not contain types of directives nor 
  somanager.num_listeners.

* Support for interface parameters.

* Real implementation of interface specification according
  to the configuration file.

* Real implementation of mfigure.

* Real implementation of engine configuration functions.

* ptasker may not handle tasks in the task queue well.

* Usage of autoconf to decide the modules to be compiled.

* Separate make files for XMLDSQL, Engine-XMLD and ptasker.

Issues:
-------

* Encode user passwords.

* rename XMLDFile.element_pos.

*--------------- Start of OpenXMLD 0.8.0 part:

Goal: Portability.

* Thread-safe OpenXMLD.

* Implement a multi-threaded multi-
tasker (Macro: USE_TTASKER).

* Re-implement fmanager using a flock-independent way
once MULTI_THREAD_MTASKER is on.

* Implement a path translator that modifies the path
according to the OS.
